<h2> About me </h2>
<p>I' m currently a student of Computer Science and Econometrics at University of Gda≈Ñsk.<br>
As for now I focus on improving my knowledge about Java. <br>
My goal is to learn how to create plugins for Minecraft, <br>
and in the near future to create mobile applications using Android SDK. <br>
In the future I would love to work as a programmer in game development. </p>
